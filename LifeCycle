For a prototype like Repair Radar—where requirements might evolve as you gather user feedback and adjust your approach—an **Agile/Iterative development life-cycle model** is highly recommended.

### Why Agile/Iterative?
- **Rapid Prototyping:** You can quickly build a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate key functionalities, such as data ingestion, anomaly detection, and reporting dashboards.
- **Flexibility:** Requirements for innovative solutions often evolve. Agile lets you refine features in successive sprints based on stakeholder and user feedback.
- **Continuous Integration & Testing:** Regular iterations facilitate unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) early and throughout the development cycle.
- **Risk Management:** By incrementally developing and reviewing the product, you reduce the risk of late-stage surprises and can pivot if necessary.

### How to Structure the Agile Process:
1. **Sprint Planning:** Define short sprints (e.g., 2–4 weeks) with clear goals—like setting up the data pipeline or implementing the first version of the anomaly detection module.
2. **Development & Testing:** Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure quality and maintainability. Write tests as you develop features.
3. **Review & Feedback:** At the end of each sprint, demo the prototype, collect feedback, and adjust the backlog.
4. **Iteration:** Use the feedback to refine your product, add new features, or re-prioritize tasks for the next sprint.
5. **Documentation & Standards:** Maintain comprehensive documentation and adhere to software engineering standards (such as those from IEEE or ISO) throughout the process.

This approach not only aligns with modern software engineering practices but also sets the stage for a robust, scalable product that can be easily refined into a market-ready solution.
