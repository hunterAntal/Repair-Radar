## **Sprint 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline**

### **Objectives:**
- **Establish the Development Environment:** Set up version control, CI/CD, and project management tools.
- **Design the System Architecture:** Define key data models and overall design.
- **Create a Simulated Data Generator:** Build a module that mimics work order data.
- **Implement a Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Ingest, transform, and store the simulated data.
- **Perform Initial Analysis & Anomaly Detection:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a basic anomaly detection module.
- **Prepare a Sprint Demo:** Showcase a simple end-to-end flow from data simulation to pattern detection.

### **Tasks & Deliverables:**

1. **Environment Setup & Tooling:**
   - Configure the Git repository, issue tracking, and continuous integration (CI) tools.
   - Decide on the technology stack (e.g., Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

2. **Requirement Analysis & Architecture Design:**
   - Document high-level system requirements and design a simple architecture diagram.
   - Define data models for work orders (fields like Work Order ID, Date, Location, Severity, Repair Cost, etc.).

3. **Data Simulation Module:**
   - Develop a Python script/module to generate synthetic work order data.
   - Ensure the module outputs a CSV (or another preferred format) that mimics real work orders.
   - Incorporate variability for different incident types (normal, chronic offenders, etc.).

4. **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
   - Create a module to load the simulated data into an in-memory data structure or a lightweight database.
   - Apply basic data transformations (e.g., converting dates, encoding categorical fields).

5. **Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Write scripts to compute summary statistics (incident counts, average repair costs, etc.).
   - Generate simple visualizations (e.g., bar charts for incidents per building) to validate the simulated data.

6. **Basic Anomaly Detection Prototype:**
   - Implement a simple, threshold-based anomaly detection algorithm as a first pass.
   - Use the simulated dataset to flag outliers (e.g., unusually high repair costs or frequent incidents).

7. **Testing & Documentation:**
   - Develop unit tests for the data simulation and ingestion modules.
   - Document the architecture, design decisions, and usage instructions.

8. **Sprint Review & Demo:**
   - Prepare a short demo that shows:
     - The simulated data generation.
     - The ingestion pipeline and EDA outputs.
     - The initial anomaly detection in action.
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders to plan subsequent iterations.

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- A functioning prototype that simulates data and processes it through an ingestion pipeline.
- Initial visual insights and alerts demonstrating the potential of Repair Radar.
- A solid foundation and documented codebase for expanding features in future sprints.
