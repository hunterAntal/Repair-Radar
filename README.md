### **Repair Radar: Smarter Maintenance, Safer Residences**

#### **What is Repair Radar?**  
Repair Radar is a data-driven maintenance tracking system that uses advanced analytics—like anomaly detection and predictive modeling—to help universities optimize housing repairs. By analyzing work orders and spotting recurring patterns, it enables residence managers to **proactively** address issues, reduce costs, and create a safer, more comfortable living environment for students.

#### **How It Works:**  
1. **Advanced Analytics** – Our system applies industry-standard machine learning (e.g., Isolation Forest for anomaly detection) to large volumes of work-order data.  
2. **Chronic Issue Identification** – Buildings or hallways showing unusually high frequencies of specific problems (like broken door handles) get flagged for a deeper look.  
3. **Cost Forecasting** – Predictive models estimate future repair budgets, so you can plan ahead with confidence.  
4. **Custom Reports & Alerts** – Repair Radar delivers real-time dashboards and alerts whenever a building’s incident rate spikes above the norm.  

#### **Key Benefits:**  
- **Efficiency Boost**: Automates data analysis, freeing up staff for higher-value tasks.  
- **Cost Savings**: Identifies repeat issues early—potentially cutting repair costs by up to 20%.  
- **Proactive Housing Management**: From “reactive to predictive,” giving you a head start on preventing larger issues.  
- **Fair & Transparent**: Focuses on anonymized data and location-based trends, ensuring ethical use.  

#### **Use Case Example:**  
**Before Repair Radar:**  
- Maintenance teams often “fight fires” as they arise, overlooking recurring structural flaws or student habits that lead to damage.  
- Budgets are unpredictable, and chronic problem areas slip through the cracks.

**After Repair Radar:**  
- Residence managers see a **dashboard** showing Building A has 2x the average repair requests—most of them are door-handle malfunctions.  
- A quick investigation reveals a design flaw in the door hardware, leading to a bulk replacement that saves 30% over piecemeal fixes.  
- The system’s **predictive analytics** forecast higher damage reports near semester’s end, allowing managers to schedule extra staff proactively.
